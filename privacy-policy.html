          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to the Psychic Tournament app (the
            "Application") provided by Over Nine Thousand (the "Service
            Provider"). The Application is offered as an ad-supported service
            and is provided "AS IS".
          </p>

          <h2>
            What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?
          </h2>
          <b>User Provided Information</b>
          <p>
            The Application acquires the information you supply when you
            download and register the Application. Registration with the Service
            Provider is not mandatory. However, some features may be unavailable
            unless you register.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service Provider may also use the information you provide to
            contact you from time to time with important information, required
            notices, and marketing promotions.
          </p>

          <b>Automatically Collected Information</b>
          <p>
            The Application may collect certain information automatically,
            including but not limited to the type of mobile device you use, your
            device's unique ID, IP address, mobile operating system, type of
            mobile internet browser, and information about how you use the
            Application.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Does the Application collect precise real time location information
            of the device?
          </h2>
          <p>
            No. This Application does not gather precise information about the
            location of your mobile device.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by
            the Application?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to
            external services to help improve the Application and services. The
            Service Provider may share your information with third parties as
            described in this privacy statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that the Application utilizes third‑party services that
            have their own Privacy Policies. Below are the third‑party service
            providers used by the Application:

            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>
            The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically
            Collected Information:
          </b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar
              legal process;
            </li>
            <li>
              when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
              protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
              investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
            </li>
            <li>
              with trusted service providers who work on their behalf, do not
              have an independent use of the information, and have agreed to
              adhere to this privacy statement.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What are my opt‑out rights?</h2>
          <p>
            You can halt all collection of information by the Application by
            uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes
            available on your device or via the application marketplace or
            network.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as
            you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter.
            Automatically Collected information will be retained for up to 24
            months and thereafter may be stored in aggregate. If you'd like the
            Service Provider to delete User Provided Data that you have provided
            via the Application, please contact them at 1441 Vista Del Valle
            Way, La Habra Heights, CA, 90631, and they will respond in a
            reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the User Provided
            Data may be required for the Application to function properly.
          </p>

          <h2>Children</h2>
          <p>
            The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly
            solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. The
            Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service
            Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from children under 13 years of age. If the Service
            Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal
            information, they will immediately delete this from their servers.
            If you are a parent or guardian and aware that your child has
            provided personal information, please contact the Service Provider
            (1441 Vista Del Valle Way, La Habra Heights, CA, 90631) so that they
            can take the necessary actions.
          </p>

          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the
            confidentiality of your information. They provide physical,
            electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information
            processed and maintained. Access is limited to authorized employees
            and contractors who need to know that information to operate,
            develop, or improve the Application. However, no security system can
            prevent all potential breaches.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
            The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating this
            page. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for
            any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-08-16</p>

          <h2>Your Consent</h2>
          <p>
            By using the Application, you consent to the Service Provider's
            processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy
            now and as amended by them. "Processing" means using cookies on a
            device or using or touching information in any way, including but
            not limited to collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining, and
            disclosing information.
